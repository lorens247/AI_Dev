-- Fix Foreign Key Constraint Issue
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to fix the created_by constraint

-- First, check current foreign key constraints

-- Drop the problematic foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE public.polls DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS polls_created_by_fkey;

-- Add the correct foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE public.polls 
ADD CONSTRAINT polls_created_by_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Also fix the votes table foreign key
ALTER TABLE public.votes DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS votes_user_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE public.votes
